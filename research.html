                  <h1>PRISM</h1>
                  <p>PRISM is an innovative mind-body intervention system that addresses limitations in traditional mental health treatments by combining advanced technology with personalized mindfulness approaches. The system uses EEG-EMG corticomuscular coupling to create detailed stress maps of the body while incorporating AI to adapt mindfulness techniques to each user's unique needs. What sets PRISM apart is its ability to precisely track and localize stress patterns in real-time, learning from each individual's brain-body signals to create a truly personalized experience. Through Bluetooth EMG technology, the platform offers scalable, accessible solutions that can be integrated into clinical therapy settings or used for personal wellness, bridging the gap between traditional therapeutic approaches and modern technological capabilities.</p>

                  <h1>HYPR</h1>
                  <p>HYPR (HYPER-PRIME) is an advanced learning system that combines neurofeedback technology with augmented reality to enhance meta-comprehension abilities. The platform features a dynamic feedback loop that analyzes learning patterns in real-time, while providing hypercorrection during both encoding and retrieval phases of learning. What makes HYPR unique is its integration of AI-powered AR glasses that deliver targeted cues and predictive responses based on neural signals. This automated system creates a sophisticated learning environment that adapts to individual learning patterns, offering immediate feedback and correction to optimize the learning process and achieve deeper understanding of complex material.</p>
