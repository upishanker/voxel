              <h2>Andre Quintero - Co-Founder</h2>
              <p>
                Andre is a second-year undergraduate student, pursuing a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering with a concentration in Neuroscience at Florida State University. As the Founder of the BCI Lab, he aspires to bridge the various fields which form the promising intersection of Neuroengineering. He is also a Lead Researcher in the Martin Memory Lab managed by Dr. Chris Martin, using EEG to study learning mechanisms and memory consolidation. Andre looks forward to integrating different neuroimaging and stimulation techniques to the latest technologies in order to quantify mental states of focus and intention and promote dynamic feedback loops for user engagement. He intends to explore and utilize machine learning algorithms to assist in object recognition for an assistive cognitive analysis. Andre is an avid polymath who enjoys reading books on various emerging topics in relevant fields, programming, weightlifting, boxing, and developing new skills.

              <p>
                Shyam graduated from the University of Florida with a B.S. in Psychology, where he studied the impact of peak experiences on prosocial behavior. He is now the Study Coordinator of the Riddle Lab at Florida State University where he is investigating how neural oscillations coordinate functional brain networks during high-order cognitive processes. Shyam is spearheading a study aiming to uncover the neurocognitive dynamics of clinically relevant phenomena during advanced meditation retreats. Alongside the Emergent Phenomenology Research Consortium (EPRC), Shyam seeks to contextualize self-transcendent experiences for caregivers to optimally support patients undergoing spiritual transformation. As a Co-Founder of the BCI Lab, he aims to create an AI-driven wellness platform to provide personalized mindfulness protocols aligned with users’ subjective experiences, goals, values, and biometrics data. Shyam’s passions extend to organizing communities to help individuals on their unique wellness journeys through mental health resources, mindfulness-based practices. and peer-to-peer support.
